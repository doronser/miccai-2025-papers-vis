  "title": "MvHo-IB: Multi-View Higher-Order Information Bottleneck for Brain Disorder Diagnosis",
  "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that modeling higher-order interactions (HOIs) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can enhance the diagnostic accuracy of machine learning systems. However, effectively extracting and leveraging HOIs remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework that seamlessly integrates pairwise interactions and HOIs for diagnostic decision-making while automatically compressing task-irrelevant redundant information. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a principled framework combining $\\mathcal{O}$-information from information theory with the recently developed matrix-based R'enyiâ€™s $\\alpha$-order entropy functional estimator to quantify and extract HOIs, (2) a purpose-built Brain3DCNN encoder designed to effectively utilize these interactions, and (3) a novel multiview learning information bottleneck objective to enhance representation learning. Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that MvHo-IB achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods, including modern hypergraph-based techniques, by significant margins. The code of our MvHo-IB is available at \\url{https://github.com/zky04/MvHo-IB}.",
