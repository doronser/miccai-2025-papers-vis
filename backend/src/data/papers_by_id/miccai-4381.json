  "title": "Abnormality-Driven Representation Learning for Radiology Imaging",
  "abstract": "Radiology deep learning pipelines predominantly employ end-to-end 3D networks based on models pre-trained on other tasks, which are then fine-tuned on the task at hand. In contrast, adjacent medical fields such as pathology, which focus on 2D images, have effectively adopted task-agnostic foundational models based on self-supervised learning, combined with weakly-supervised deep learning. However, the field of radiology still lacks task-agnostic representation models due to the computational and data demands of 3D imaging and the anatomical complexity inherent to radiology scans. To address this gap, we propose CLEAR, a framework for 3D radiology images that uses extracted embeddings from 2D slices along with attention-based aggregation to efficiently predict clinical endpoints. As part of this framework, we introduce LECL, a novel approach to obtain visual representations driven by abnormalities in 2D axial slices across different locations of the CT scans.\nSpecifically, we trained single-domain contrastive learning approaches using three different architectures: Vision Transformers, Vision State Space Models and Gated Convolutional Neural Networks. We evaluate our approach across three clinical tasks: tumor lesion location, lung disease detection, and patient staging, benchmarking against four state-of-the-art foundation models, including BiomedCLIP. Our findings demonstrate that CLEAR, using representations learned through LECL, outperforms existing foundation models, while being substantially more compute- and data-efficient.
