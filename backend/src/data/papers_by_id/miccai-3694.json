  "title": "PFESA: FFT-based Parameter-Free Edge and Structure Attention for Medical Image Segmentation",
  "abstract": "The U-Net architecture remains pivotal in medical image segmentation, yet its skip connections often propagate redundant noise and compromise edge information. We propose a Parameter-Free Edge and Structure Attention (PFESA) based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to address these limitations. PFESA employs frequency-domain feature decoupling to separate high-frequency (edge details) and low-frequency (structural components) representations. Leveraging feature Signal-to-Noise Ratio(SNR) analysis, we devise dual attention paths: a High-frequency Edge Attention (EA) enhances gradient-sensitive regions to preserve anatomical contours, while a Low-frequency Structure Attention (SA) suppresses noise through energy redistribution. This frequency-aware attention mechanism enables adaptive feature refinement in skip connections without introducing trainable parameters. The parameter-free design ensures robustness against overfitting in medical datasets with scarce data. Extensive experiments on multi modal 2D/3D medical image datasets demonstrate PFESAâ€™s superiority over existing attention methods, achieving SOTA performance with statistically significant improvements in Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC: +3.3% vs.baseline) and Hausdorff Distance metrics.
