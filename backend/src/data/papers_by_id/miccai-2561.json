  "title": "Cross-Modality Supervised Prostate Segmentation on CBCT for Adaptive Radiotherapy",
  "abstract": "Accurate organ segmentation is crucial for prostate cancer radiotherapy, but cone-beam computer tomography (CBCT) based models are hindered by low image quality and annotation scarcity. Existing approaches rely on deformable registration, which struggles with soft-tissue deformations, or direct CBCT training, which suffers from domain shifts and low-quality labels. We propose a domain adaptation framework that enables robust prostate segmentation on CBCT using cross-modality supervision from planning CT (pCT). A cycle-consistent generative adversarial network translates pCT into synthetic CBCT, enabling segmentation models to train on high-quality pCT-derived annotations while adapting to CBCT characteristics. Additionally, anatomy-aware augmentation enhances robustness to organ deformations across diverse patient anatomies. Using a multi-center dataset, our approach achieves segmentation accuracy comparable to pCT-trained models. By eliminating the need for manual CBCT annotations, our method enables practical AI-driven segmentation for adaptive radiotherapy.",
