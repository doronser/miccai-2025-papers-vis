  "title": "Feature Mixing Approach for Detecting Intraoperative Adverse Events in Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery",
  "abstract": "Intraoperative adverse events (IAEs), such as bleeding or thermal injury, can lead to severe postoperative complications if undetected. However, their rarity results in highly imbalanced datasets, posing challenges for AI-based detection and severity quantification. We propose BetaMixer, a novel deep learning model that addresses these challenges through a Beta distribution-based mixing approach, converting discrete IAE severity scores into continuous values for precise severity regression (0-5 scale). BetaMixer employs Beta distribution-based sampling to enhance underrepresented classes and regularizes intermediate embeddings to maintain a structured feature space. A generative approach aligns the feature space with sampled IAE severity, enabling robust classification and severity regression via a transformer. Evaluated on the MultiBypass140 dataset, which we extended with IAE labels, BetaMixer achieves a weighted F1 score of 0.76, recall of 0.81, PPV of 0.73, and NPV of 0.84, demonstrating strong performance on imbalanced data. By integrating Beta distribution-based sampling, feature mixing, and generative modeling, BetaMixer offers a robust solution for IAE detection and quantification in clinical settings.",
