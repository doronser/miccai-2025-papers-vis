  "title": "NQNN: Noise-aware Quantum Neural Networks for Medical Image Classification",
  "abstract": "Noisy labels in high-dimensional, and multiclass medical im-\nage datasets pose a significant challenge for machine learning models.\nWhile hybrid quantum-classical architectures, such as quantum neural\nnetworks (QNNs), have shown promise in medical imaging, their ro-\nbustness under noisy label conditions remains largely unexplored. To\naddress this gap, we propose a Noise-aware Quantum Neural Network\n(NQNN), integrating Fourier Attenuation, Reweight Estimation, and\nAdaptive Pooling to enhance feature extraction and classification ro-\nbustness. Fourier Attenuation filters high-frequency noise, Reweight Es-\ntimation prioritizes cleaner labels based on uncertainty, and Adaptive\nPooling dynamically refines feature aggregation. We evaluate NQNN on\nsix benchmark medical datasets (PathMNIST, BloodMNIST, OrganAM-\nNIST, OrganCMNIST, OCTMNIST, and DermaMNIST) across noise ra-\ntios (10%, 30%, and 50%) and classification configurations (binary, four-\nclass, and full multiclass). Comparative benchmarks against five QNN-\nbased and two deep-learning baselines demonstrate NQNNâ€™s superior\nperformance, such that achieving 80.25% accuracy on organCMNIST at\n10% noise and maintaining strong performance at higher noise ratios.\nOur ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each noise-handling\nmechanism, highlighting their complementary contributions to noise ro-\nbustness. By bridging quantum advancements with real-world medical di-\nagnostics, NQNN establishes a new benchmark for noise-resilient medical\nimage classification, offering a scalable and adaptive quantum-classical\nlearning framework.",
