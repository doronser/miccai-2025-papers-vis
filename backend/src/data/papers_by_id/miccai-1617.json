  "title": "PD-UniST: Prompt-Driven Universal Model for Unpaired H&E-to-IHC Stain Translation",
  "abstract": "Virtual staining, which leverages generative artificial intelli- gence (AI) to produce immunohistochemistry (IHC)-stained tissue samples from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained images, has emerged as a cost-effective and accessible alternative to traditional IHC staining. Despite its potential, this approach faces three significant challenges: (1) the necessity of training a separate model for each tumor marker used in IHC staining, (2) the limited availability of large-scale datasets, and (3) the inherent diversity of staining patterns across different tissue types and markers. In this study, we address these challenges by introducing the Prompt-Driven Universal model for unpaired H&E-to-IHC Stain Translation (PD-UniST). Our approach incorporates two key innovations: (1) Structure-Cognizant Organization Prompt ModulE (SCOPE), which employs textual prompts to guide region-specific generation, and (2) Style-Prompt Unified Mapping ModulE (SPUME), which utilizes learnable prompts to capture task differences between various IHC stains and features a pathology-specific prompt-aware fusion layer for effective integration of visual features with task-specific prompts. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one private dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the art performance across five different translation tasks, significantly improving both structural preservation and staining pattern accuracy. In clinical evaluation, we further validate the effectiveness of our method through pathologistsâ€™ assessment of both public and private datasets.
