  "title": "Advancing Medical Representation Learning Through High-Quality Data",
  "abstract": "Despite the growing scale of medical Vision-Language datasets, the impact of dataset quality on model performance remains under-explored. We introduce Open-PMC, a high-quality medical dataset from PubMed Central, containing 2.2 million image-text pairs, enriched with image modality annotations, subfigures, and summarized in-text references. Notably, the in-text references provide richer medical context, extending beyond the abstract information typically found in captions. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark Open-PMC against larger datasets across retrieval and zero-shot classification tasks. Our results show that dataset quality-not just size-drives significant performance gains. We complement our benchmark with an in-depth analysis of feature representation. Our findings highlight the crucial role of data curation quality in advancing multimodal medical AI. We release Open-PMC, along with the trained models and our codebase.",
