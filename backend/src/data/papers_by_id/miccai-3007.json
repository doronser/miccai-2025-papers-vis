  "title": "Noisy Label Refinement Based on Discrete Diffusion Process in 3D Ossicle Segmentation",
  "abstract": "Ossicular chain lesions can cause hearing loss, making accurate segmentation of ossicles critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Ultra-high-resolution computed tomography (U-HRCT) provides quality images for ossicle segmentation tasks, but the complex structure of the stapes and variations in annotatorsâ€™ experience often lead to noisy labels in 3D annotation within clinical practice. To address this, we propose a novel framework tailored for two types of noisy labels: (1) incomplete-structure labels, and (2) complete-structure but inaccurate labels. For the former, we introduce a Dilating&Selecting (D&S) framework, which completes missing structures using a dilating Volumetric Discrete Diffusion Refiner (VDDR) with a novel cover loss and evaluates label completeness via a completeness selection strategy. For the latter, we introduce a noise-based augmentation to better train VDDR. Experimental results demonstrate that D&S framework reduce the time cost of manual annotation by 90.2%, while VDDR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. To facilitate further research and development, our code and two datasets are publicly available.",
