  "title": "Masked Contrastive Language-Image Modeling For Brain Segmentation",
  "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to mitigate neuroimaging analysis algorithmsâ€™ reliance on annotated data. However, existing SSL methods for brain MRI often fail to incorporate anatomical priors inherent in brain MRI, limiting their effectiveness. Here, we present Masked Contrastive Language-Image Modeling (MCLIM), a novel SSL framework that integrates knowledge from brain atlases through text-guided representation learning. We first generate structure-specific textual descriptors based on brain atlases, with no need for manually collecting image-text pairs. Then MCLIM employs (1) an image restoration branch that reconstructs randomly masked image patches through an encoder-decoder network, and (2) a cross-modal alignment module that establishes semantic correspondences between image features and atlas-derived text embeddings. These two learning objectives enable the simultaneous capture of fine-grained intensity patterns and whole-brain topological relationships. The proposed method is fine-tuned and evaluated on three brain parcellation datasets with varying granularities and a brain lesion segmentation dataset. Experiment results demonstrate that MCLIM outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods and reduces annotation effort by at least 40%. Code and pre-trained models will be available at https://github.com/CRazorback/MCLIM.",
