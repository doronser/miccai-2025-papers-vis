  "title": "CD-PolypNet: Cross-Domain Polyp Segmentation Network with Internal Feature Distillation and Dual-Stream Boundary Focus via Large Vision Model",
  "abstract": "Leveraging large vision models (LVMs), such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), in medical image analysis presents significant potential to enhance diagnostic efficiency. Existing SAM-based medical segmentation methods inadequately address two critical challenges: rapidly adapting LVMs to medical tasks through few-shot fine-tuning, and the inherent difficulty in distinguishing lesions from anatomically similar background regions in medical images. To overcome these limitations, we propose CD-PolypNet, a novel framework integrating a Semantic Supervision via Feature Distillation (SSFD) and an Edge-Guided Feature Branch (EFB). \nThe SSFD module leverages feature distillation to transfer knowledge from SAMâ€™s strongly supervised features into early-stage feature learning, enabling efficient domain adaptation of large vision models under data scarcity. Concurrently, EFB enhances boundary discrimination in lightweight decoder through a hybrid strategy combining the Canny operator and Edge-Frequency Gated Convolution (EFGConv), thereby prioritizing edge-aware feature extraction. Extensive experiments across five challenging medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our method not only surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy and robustness but also establishes a new paradigm for cross-domain adaptation of large vision models in specialized medical applications.
