  "title": "XOCT: Enhancing OCT to OCTA Translation via Cross-Dimensional Supervised Multi-Scale Feature Learning",
  "abstract": "Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details necessary for reliable diagnosis.To overcome these limitations, we propose XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset demonstrate XOCTâ€™s improvements, especially for the en-face projections which are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring.
