  "title": "Meta-Learning Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Personalized Cardiac Modeling",
  "abstract": "The advancement of personalized cardiac modeling, particularly through digital cardiac twins, enables tailored treatments based on the physiology of the individual patient. Traditional physics-based methods for optimizing the parameters of these cardiac models face challenges in clinical adoption due to their computational cost. Recent shifts towards data-driven approaches offer improved efficiency, but struggle with generalization and integration of core electrophysiological principles. The emerging use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has the potential to combine the advantage of these two approaches, although still requiring retraining from scratch for each subject. This paper introduces a novel framework for meta-learning PINNs to overcome these challenges, enabling rapid personalization of a PINN to new subjectsâ€™ data via simple feedforward computation.\nWe instantiate this meta-PINN framework using the Eikonal model as the governing physics, demonstrating its efficacy in significantly reducing computational demands while improving the predictive accuracy of personalized cardiac models.",
