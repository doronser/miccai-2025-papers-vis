  "title": "SAMUSA: Segment Anything Model 2 for UltraSound Annotation",
  "abstract": "Interactive segmentation tools, such as SAM2, have shown strong performance in reducing annotation effort in natural images. However, unlike natural images, ultrasound images and videos often lack well-defined structure boundaries, which significantly degrade the performance of region-based point prompts in SAM models. To address these limitations, we introduce the Segment Anything Model 2 for UltraSound Annotation (SAMUSA). SAMUSA is based on SAM2 and introduces a new prompt strategy with boundary and temporal points, along with a novel boundary loss function, enabling the model to more efficiently segment structures with poorly defined boundaries, such as liver masses. We integrated SAMUSA as a 3D Slicer plugin, where it can be used for US videos and 3D US volumes segmentation. We present a prospective user study involving 6 participants (3 surgeons and 3 radiographers), which showed an average 34.1% annotation time reduction for image liver mass segmentation.",
