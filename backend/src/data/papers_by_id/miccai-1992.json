  "title": "Multi-scale Attention-based Multiple Instance Learning for Breast Cancer Diagnosis",
  "abstract": "Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a powerful weakly supervised learning framework for high-resolution medical images, but its application in mammographic breast cancer (BC) diagnosis overlooks instance interactions and the multi-scale nature of BC lesions. In this work, we propose a novel Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)-MIL model for BC classification and detection in high-resolution mammograms, integrating (1) a FPN-based instance encoder that enables a multi-scale analysis across different receptive-field granularities while operating on single-scale input patches; (2) deep-supervised scale-specific instance aggregators that support conventional attention (AbMIL) or transformer-based (SetTrans) mechanisms; (3) an attention-based multi-scale aggregator that dynamically combines scale-specific features, improving robustness to lesion scale variability. Our experiments show that FPN-MIL is superior to conventional single- and multi-scale patch-based MIL models, with FPN-SetTrans outperforming baselines in calcification classification and detection while FPN-AbMIL performs best for mass classification.",
