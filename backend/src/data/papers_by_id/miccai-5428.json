  "title": "MIBF-Net: Multi-modal Information Balanced Fusion Network for Clinical Diagnosis via Patient Narratives and Lesion Image",
  "abstract": "Accurate clinical diagnosis requires comprehensive analysis of medical imaging and patient narratives. However, current computer-aided diagnosis methods focus primarily on imaging modalities while neglecting the integration of patient-reported clinical narratives, due to the scarcity of high-quality patient narratives and the limitations in multimodal information fusion. To address these issues, we propose a dual-component framework consisting of: 1) a Retrieval-Augmented Patient Narratives Generation Module (RANGM) that employs a retrieval-enhanced mechanism to guide pre-trained large language models in generating clinically plausible patient narratives; and 2) a Multimodal Information Balanced Fusion Network (MIBF-Net) incorporating our novel Information Balanced Fusion Attention (IBFA) module for effective cross-modal integration, along with a Modal Prediction-Divergent Loss (MPL) to enhance the modelâ€™s ability to diagnose samples that have single modal prediction distribution ambiguous. Owing to the plug-and-play design, our MIBF-Net can integrate with existing imaging-based state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements of 2.3%-4.6% on the HAM10000 dataset and 3.8%-6.4% on the ISIC2019 dataset.
