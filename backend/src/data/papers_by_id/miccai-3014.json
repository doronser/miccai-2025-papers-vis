  "title": "World Model for AI Autonomous Navigation in Mechanical Thrombectomy",
  "abstract": "Autonomous navigation for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains a critical challenge due to the complexity of vascular anatomy and the need for precise, real-time decision-making. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have demonstrated potential in automating endovascular navigation, but current methods often struggle with generalization across multiple patient vasculatures and long-horizon tasks. We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate compared to SACâ€™s 37% (p < 0.001), with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2 exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success rate and execution speed. These findings highlight the potential of world models for improving autonomous endovascular navigation and lay the foundation for future research in generalizable AI-driven robotic interventions.",
