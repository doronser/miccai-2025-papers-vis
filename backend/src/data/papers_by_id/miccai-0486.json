  "title": "CARE-VL: A Domain-Specialized Vision-Language Model for Early ASD Screening",
  "abstract": "We propose an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) screening framework that integrates an expert vision-language model (VLM), CARE-VL, with a large language model (LLM)-based aggregation module to assess children’s social interactions and derive subject-level ASD/typical development (TD) classifications.\nOur framework processes video data collected using social interaction-inducing content, where medical experts annotated predefined query-response (Q-R) intervals based on key social indicators—such as response to name, eye contact, imitation behavior, social smiling, and pointing—by marking correct responses and assigning subject-level ASD/TD classifications. \nTo adapt the general-purpose VLM to the ASD screening domain, we constructed a synthetic instruction-tuning dataset using a label-guided reasoning method on these clinical tags, fine-tuning the model to generate detailed captions and multiple-choice question-answer (MC-QA) pairs, capturing children’s critical social behaviors.\nCARE-VL processes Q-R intervals to produce clip-level MC-QA results and descriptive captions, which are then aggregated by an LLM to derive final ASD/TD classification and clinical reasoning.\nOur end-to-end framework combines visual understanding and linguistic reasoning, achieving 84.6% accuracy for clip-level response prediction and 75.8% accuracy for subject-level ASD/TD classification. These results demonstrate the potential of our framework as a practical and interpretable tool for early ASD screening and behavioral assessment.
