  "title": "DiDGen: Diffusion-based Dual-task Synthesis for Dermoscopic Data Generation",
  "abstract": "Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for skin lesion analysis reduce costs and workload associated with the manual inspection of skin diseases. Nevertheless, the performance of deep learning (DL)-based CAD systems is constrained by the limited availability of labeled data, necessitating advanced dataset augmentation techniques. To address this limitation, we propose DiDGen, a novel method that employs Diffusion models (DMs) for Dermoscopic image Generation and lesion-mask pair synthesis. Specifically, we introduce DermPrompt, a new type of structured text prompt rich with clinical details annotated by large language models (LLMs), which facilitates DMsâ€™ learning of fine-grained visual representations. Additionally, we propose a new paradigm for lesion-mask pair synthesis by incorporating a region-aware attention loss during finetuning to facilitate the build of semantic connections between text and visual representations, and then integrating test-time layout guidance with attention-based annotation to synthesize diverse and accurate lesion-mask pairs in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method improves the quality and diagnostic utility of generated dermoscopic images, thereby enhancing DL model performance in skin lesion classification and segmentation tasks.
