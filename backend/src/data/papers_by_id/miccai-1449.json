  "title": "CardiacFlow: 3D+t Four-Chamber Cardiac Shape Completion and Generation via Flow Matching",
  "abstract": "Learning 3D+t shape completion and generation from multi-view cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images requires a large amount of high-resolution 3D whole-heart segmentations (WHS) to capture shape priors. In this work, we leverage flow matching techniques to learn deep generative flows for augmentation, completion, and generation of 3D+t shapes of four cardiac chambers represented implicitly by segmentations. Firstly, we introduce a latent rectified flow to generate 3D cardiac shapes for data augmentation, learned from a limited number of 3D WHS data. Then, a label completion network is trained on both real and synthetic data to reconstruct 3D+t shapes from sparse multi-view CMR segmentations. Lastly, we propose CardiacFlow, a novel one-step generative flow model for efficient 3D+t four-chamber cardiac shape generation, conditioned on the periodic Gaussian kernel encoding of time frames. The experiments on the WHS datasets demonstrate that flow-based data augmentation reduces geometric errors by 16% in 3D shape completion. The evaluation on the UK Biobank dataset validates that CardiacFlow achieves superior generation quality and periodic consistency compared to existing baselines.",
