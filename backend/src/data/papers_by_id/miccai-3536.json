  "title": "Multi-Modal Progressive Fusion for ASD Screening Using Smartphone Video",
  "abstract": "Screening for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is an important yet challenging task. Traditional screening tools, such as questionnaires and other technical methods, face difficulties in large-scale implementation, such as primary healthcare and home monitoring settings. To address this issue, we develop a smartphone application to highlight atypical eye movement behaviors in children with ASD and extract multi-modal features, including eye movements, head pose, and emotional expressions, from smartphone videos to characterize the subjectsâ€™ viewing behavior. Additionally, we propose a multi-modal progressive fusion framework to comprehensively integrate the relationships between different modalities. The progressive fusion strategy combines multi-modal features at multiple scales to achieve attention-based deep fusion. Moreover, we develop a global intra- and inter-modality interaction (GIIMI) module to enhance competition and interaction within and between modalities. In the experiment, we constructed a smartphone video dataset of 124 children aged 3 to 6 years and validated the performance advantages of the proposed algorithm.",
