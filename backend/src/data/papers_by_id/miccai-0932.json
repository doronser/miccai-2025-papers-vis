  "title": "MVP-LLMs: Optimizing Intervention Timing and Subsequent Decision Support for Mechanical Ventilation Parameter Control Using Large Language Models",
  "abstract": "Since the COVID-19 outbreak, global health systems have faced unprecedented challenges, with mechanical ventilation playing a critical role in supporting patients in ICUs. However, precise adjustment of ventilation parameters remains complex, requiring continuous monitoring and personalized interventions by clinicians. This paper introduces a novel formulation of ventilator parameter adjustment as a composite problem involving optimal stopping and subsequent decision optimization, supported by a domain-specific dataset reflecting real-world scenarios. We propose a framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance interactivity and interpretability, leveraging their extensive clinical knowledge from large text corpora for informed decision-making. The framework addresses two key tasks: developing scheduled prompts for optimal stopping to replicate clinical observation processes and implementing Best Action Imitation Learning for robust ventilator parameter optimization. Experimental results show significant improvements in LLMsâ€™ ability to predict optimal stopping points and optimize decision-making, advancing clinical ventilator control. To our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to this dual-task paradigm.",
