  "title": "MAST-Pro: Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Adaptive Segmentation of Pan-Tumors with Knowledge-Driven Prompts",
  "abstract": "Accurate tumor segmentation is crucial for cancer diagnosis and treatment. While foundation models have advanced general-purpose segmentation, existing methods still struggle with: (1) limited incorporation of medical priors, (2) imbalance between generic and tumor-specific features, and (3) high computational costs for clinical adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose MAST-Pro M}ixture-of-experts for Adaptive Segmentation of pan-Tumors with knowledge-driven Prompts), a novel framework that integrates dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (D-MoE) and knowledge-driven prompts for pan-tumor segmentation. Specifically, text and anatomical prompts provide domain-specific priors, guiding tumor representation learning, while D-MoE dynamically selects experts to balance generic and tumor-specific feature learning, improving segmentation accuracy across diverse tumor types. To enhance efficiency, we employ Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), optimizing MAST-Pro with significantly reduced computational overhead. Experiments on multi-anatomical tumor datasets demonstrate that MAST-Pro outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to a 5.20\\% improvement in average DSC while reducing trainable parameters by 91.04\\%, without compromising accuracy.",
