  "title": "Wavelet-driven Decoupling and Physics-informed Mapping Network for Accelerated Multi-parametric MR Imaging",
  "abstract": "Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an advanced MRI technique that can provide multiple quantitative maps simultaneously based on acquired multi-echo images. However, the lengthy scan time often limits its application. Accelerated multi-parametric MRI using deep learning is of great interest. The existing studies have two limitations: 1) inefficient use of the multi-echo information; 2) lack of physical prior for parametric mapping. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a novel decoupling-driven and physics-informed reconstruction network for accelerated multi-parametric MRI. Specifically, to better align and integrate multi-echo information, we propose a novel decoupling technique consisting of wavelet-driven decoupling module, contrastive and echo-dependent decoupling losses, such that the multi-echo features can be effectively decoupled into echo-dependent and echo-independent components. Only the echo-independent features are fused across multiple echoes. Besides, Bloch equations are incorporated as physical priors to guide the parametric mapping network. Experimental results on our in-house data (12-echo sequence) show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 1.54% in average SSIM and 1.70dB in average PSNR for 4Ã— acceleration, which significantly advances the performance limitation for multi-parametric MRI.
