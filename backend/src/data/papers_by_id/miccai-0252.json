  "title": "IP-CRR: Information Pursuit for Interpretable Classification of Chest Radiology Reports",
  "abstract": "The development of AI-based methods to analyze radiology\nreports could lead to significant advances in medical diagnosis, from improving\ndiagnostic accuracy to enhancing efficiency and reducing workload.\nHowever, the lack of interpretability of AI-based methods could\nhinder their adoption in clinical settings. In this paper, we propose an\ninterpretable-by-design framework for classifying chest radiology reports.\nFirst, we extract a set of representative facts from a large set of reports.\nThen, given a new report, we query whether a small subset of\nthe representative facts is entailed by the report, and predict a diagnosis\nbased on the selected subset of query-answer pairs. The explanation\nfor a prediction is, by construction, the set of selected queries\nand answers. We use the Information Pursuit framework to select the\nmost informative queries, a natural language inference model to determine if a fact is entailed by the report, and a classifier to predict the disease. Experiments on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, highlighting its potential to enhance trust and usability in medical AI.
