  "title": "Semantic-Aware Chest X-ray Report Generation with Domain-Specific Lexicon and Diversity-Controlled Retrieval",
  "abstract": "Image-to-text radiology report generation aims to produce comprehensive diagnostic reports by leveraging both X-ray images and historical textual data. Existing retrieval-based methods focus on maximizing similarity scores, leading to redundant content and limited diversity in generated reports. Additionally, they lack sensitivity to medical domain-specific information, failing to emphasize critical anatomical structures and disease characteristics essential for accurate diagnosis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented framework that integrates exemplar radiology reports with X-ray images to enhance report generation. First, we introduce a diversity-controlled retrieval strategy to improve information diversity and reduce redundancy, ensuring broader clinical knowledge coverage. Second, we develop a comprehensive medical lexicon covering chest anatomy, diseases, radiological descriptors, treatments, and related concepts. This lexicon is integrated into a weighted cross-entropy loss function to improve the modelâ€™s sensitivity to critical medical terms. Third, we introduce a sentence-level semantic loss to enhance clinical semantic accuracy. Evaluated on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, our method achieves superior performance on clinical consistency metrics and competitive results on linguistic quality metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing report accuracy and clinical relevance.",
