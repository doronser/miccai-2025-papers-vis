  "title": "Endo-CLIP: Progressive Self-Supervised Pre-training on Raw Colonoscopy Records",
  "abstract": "Pre-training on image-text colonoscopy records offers substantial potential for improving endoscopic image analysis, but faces challenges including non-informative background images, complex medical terminology, and ambiguous multi-lesion descriptions. We introduce Endo-CLIP, a novel self-supervised framework that enhances Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) for this domain. Endo-CLIP’s three stage framework—cleansing, attunement, and unification—addresses these challenges by: (1) removing background frames, (2) leveraging large language models (LLMs) to extract clinical attributes for fine-grained contrastive learning, and (3) employing patient-level cross-attention to resolve multi-polyp ambiguities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Endo-CLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pre-training methods in zero-shot and few-shot polyp detection and classification, paving the way for more accurate and clinically relevant endoscopic analysis. Code will be made publicly available on https://github.com/chrlott/EndoCLIP.",
