  "title": "On the Interplay of Human-AI Alignment, Fairness, and Performance Trade-offs in Medical Imaging",
  "abstract": "Deep neural networks excel in medical imaging but remain prone to biases, leading to fairness gaps across demographic groups. We provide the first systematic exploration of Human-AI alignment and fairness in this domain. Our results show that incorporating human insights consistently reduces fairness gaps and enhances out-of-domain generalization, though excessive alignment can introduce performance trade-offs,  emphasizing the need for calibrated strategies.  These findings highlight Human-AI alignment as a promising approach for developing fair, robust, and generalizable medical AI systems, striking a balance between expert guidance and automated efficiency. Code will be made available at ***.",
