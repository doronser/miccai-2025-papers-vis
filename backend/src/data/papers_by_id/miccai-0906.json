  "title": "LNODE: Uncovering the Latent Dynamics of Aβ in Alzheimer’s Disease",
  "abstract": "Abeta Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is often used to manage  Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To better understand Abeta progression, we introduce and evaluate  a mathematical model  that couples Abeta at parcellated gray matter regions. We term this model LNODE for ``latent network ordinary differential equations’’. At each region, we track normal Abeta, abnormal Abeta , and  m latent states that intend to capture unobservable mechanisms coupled to Abeta progression. LNODE is parameterized by subject-specific parameters  and  cohort parameters. We jointly invert for these parameters by fitting the model to Abeta -PET data from 585 subjects from the ADNI dataset. Although  underparameterized, our model achieves population R-square > 98% compared to R-square > 60% when fitting without latent states. Furthermore, these preliminary results  suggest the existence of different subtypes of Abeta progression.",
