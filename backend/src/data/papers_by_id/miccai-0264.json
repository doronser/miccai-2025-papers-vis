  "title": "Physics informed guided diffusion for accelerated multi-parametric MRI reconstruction",
  "abstract": "We introduce MRF-DiPh, a novel physics informed denoising diffusion approach for multiparametric tissue mapping from highly accelerated, transient-state quantitative MRI acquisitions like Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF). Our method is derived from a proximal splitting formulation, incorporating a pretrained denoising diffusion model as an effective image prior to regularize the MRF inverse problem. Further, during reconstruction it simultaneously enforces two key physical constraints: (1) k-space measurement consistency and (2) adherence to the Bloch response model. Numerical experiments on in-vivo brain scans data show that MRF-DiPh outperforms deep learning and compressed sensing MRF baselines, providing more accurate parameter maps while better preserving measurement fidelity and physical model consistencyâ€”critical for solving reliably inverse problems in medical imaging.",
