  "title": "Bridging Radiological Images and Factors with Vision-Language Model for Accurate Diagnosis of Proliferative Hepatocellular Carcinoma",
  "abstract": "The integration of multimodal data, particularly medical images and tabular data encompassing physician-assessed radiological factors, holds significant promise for enhancing clinical decision-making. However, effective fusion of these heterogeneous data modalities remains challenging due to their disparate feature spaces and the limitations of current independent encoding approaches. We introduce FM-Bridge, a novel methodology leveraging vision-language foundation model (VLM) to address this challenge. Our approach capitalizes on the intrinsic image-text embedding space alignment within VLMs to achieve robust multimodal fusion. We propose transforming clinical expertise-rich tabular data into semantically coherent textual descriptions, subsequently utilizing the VLMâ€™s text encoder to generate textual features explicitly aligned with image features. This method facilitates a more semantically congruent and effective fusion of medical image and tabular data, demonstrating potential for improved performance in downstream medical image analysis tasks compared to conventional methods.
