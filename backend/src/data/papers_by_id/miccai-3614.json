  "title": "Multi-Agent Collaboration for Integrating Echocardiography Expertise in Multi-Modal Large Language Models",
  "abstract": "Current echocardiography MLLMs rely on diagnostic-focused data lacking detailed image-text descriptions and systematic multi-modal cardiac knowledge, resulting in suboptimal performance across diverse echocardiography visual question answering tasks. Existing methods to integrate clinical expertise face three key challenges when adapting to echocardiography: labor-intensive curation processes, overlooking textual or diagrammatic knowledge sources essential in cardiac diagnosis, and incompatibility with pretrained MLLMs. To address these gaps, we propose Multi-Agent Collaborative Expertise Extractor (MACEE), a multi-agent framework employing MLLM-powered agents to extract echocardiography expertise from diverse sources. MACEE collects the EchoCardiography Expertise Database (ECED), the first comprehensive knowledge repository covering 100+ common and rare cardiac conditions from textbooks, guidelines, and case studies. To integrate ECED into MLLMs, we introduce Echocardiography Expertise-enhanced Visual Instruction Tuning (EEVIT), a lightweight training framework using expertise-guided instruction tuning. EEVIT employs adapters in vision and language modules, enabling efficient expertise integration while training less than 1% of the modelâ€™s parameters. Experiments validates the effectiveness of these three components. Codes and license details: https://github.com/xmed-lab/ECED",
