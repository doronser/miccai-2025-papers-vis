# Feature Specification: MICCAI 2025 Papers Visualization Webapp

**Feature Branch**: `001-plan-a-webapp`  
**Created**: 2025-09-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "plan a webapp written in python to visualize all accepted papers to MICCAI 2025 based on their abstracts, authors, link (GitHub, data, etc.) and other metadata.

The data is available here:
https://papers.miccai.org/miccai-2025/

You should probably use some embeddings and build a graph to visualize the data and include the subject areas as tags. Allow search to filter the graph. 

Do not write any code, just plan the system and suggest how to implement it. Prefer python but use react typescript if you must.

The webapp should be easily hosted and/or shared. 

The main use case is to allow researchers to quickly review the conference papers and save favorites"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature description provided: MICCAI 2025 papers visualization webapp
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: researchers
   ’ Actions: visualize, search, filter, save favorites
   ’ Data: papers, abstracts, authors, metadata, subject areas
   ’ Constraints: easy hosting/sharing, graph visualization
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: User authentication requirements not specified]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Data update frequency not specified]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flow: browse papers, search/filter, save favorites
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (papers, authors, metadata)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding auth and data updates"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A researcher preparing for MICCAI 2025 wants to efficiently explore all accepted papers to identify relevant research, understand the conference landscape, and maintain a personal collection of interesting papers for later reference.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the webapp is loaded, **When** a researcher visits the main page, **Then** they see a visual graph/network of all MICCAI 2025 papers with clear navigation options
2. **Given** papers are displayed in the graph, **When** a researcher clicks on a paper node, **Then** they see detailed information including abstract, authors, and any available links
3. **Given** the search interface is available, **When** a researcher enters keywords or filters by subject area, **Then** the graph updates to highlight matching papers
4. **Given** a researcher finds an interesting paper, **When** they mark it as a favorite, **Then** it is saved to their personal collection for later access
5. **Given** a researcher has saved favorites, **When** they access their favorites list, **Then** they can view, organize, and export their saved papers

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the data source (papers.miccai.org) is unavailable?
- How does the system handle papers with missing metadata or broken links?
- What occurs when a user's favorite list becomes very large?
- How does the system perform with the full dataset of conference papers?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display all accepted MICCAI 2025 papers in a visual graph/network format
- **FR-002**: System MUST show paper details including title, abstract, authors, and available links when selected
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide search functionality to filter papers by keywords, authors, or content
- **FR-004**: System MUST categorize papers by subject areas and allow filtering by these categories
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow researchers to save papers as favorites for later reference
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide an interface to view and manage saved favorite papers
- **FR-007**: System MUST fetch and display current paper data from https://papers.miccai.org/miccai-2025/
- **FR-008**: System MUST be accessible via web browser without requiring local installation
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide visual clustering or grouping of related papers based on content similarity
- **FR-010**: System MUST support sharing of the application or specific paper collections with other researchers
- **FR-011**: Users MUST be able to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: user authentication method not specified - anonymous use, email signup, institutional login?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST update paper data [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data refresh frequency not specified - real-time, daily, manually?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST retain user favorites [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data persistence duration not specified - session only, permanent, configurable?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Paper**: Represents a MICCAI 2025 accepted paper with title, abstract, authors, subject areas, and external links
- **Author**: Represents paper authors with name and potential affiliation information
- **Subject Area**: Categorical tags representing research domains and paper classifications
- **User Favorites**: Collection of papers saved by individual researchers for later reference
- **Paper Relationships**: Connections between papers based on content similarity, shared authors, or subject overlap
